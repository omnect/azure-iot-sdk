# azure-iot-sdk

This repository provides an object oriented wrapper of the rust unsafe bindings for the azure-iot-sdk from [azure-iot-sdk-sys](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/azure-iot-sdk-sys.git).

A reference implementation showing how this framework might be used can be found [here](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iot-client-template-rs).

# Build

Please refer to [azure-iot-sdk-sys](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/azure-iot-sdk-sys/blob/main/README.md) documentation in order to provide mandatory libraries needed to build azure-iot-sdk successfully.

An error output similar to the following example indicates that libraries are not set correctly:
>error: failed to run custom build command for `azure-iot-sdk-sys v0.2.2 (ssh://git@github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/azure-iot-sdk-sys.git?tag=0.2.2#0357acbf)`
