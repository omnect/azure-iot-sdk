# azure-iot-sdk

This repository provides an object oriented wrapper of the rust unsafe bindings for the azure-iot-sdk from [azure-iot-sdk-sys](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/azure-iot-sdk-sys.git).

A reference implementation showing how this framework might be used can be found [here](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iot-client-template-rs).

## Build SDK
If you intend to build the SDK locally the paths to the libraries listed below must be exported.
- export LIB_PATH_AZURESDK=<path to the azure iot sdk c >
- export LIB_PATH_UUID=<path to uid >
- export LIB_PATH_OPENSSL=<path to openssl >
- export LIB_PATH_CURL=<path to curl>

**We intend to provide these dependencies as public conan packages soon.**

## Generate documentation
The rustdoc documentation of the SDK is not published yet but can be locally created by `cargo doc --lib --no-deps --open`.
