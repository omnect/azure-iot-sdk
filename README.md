# azure-iot-sdk

This repository provides an object oriented wrapper of the rust unsafe bindings for the azure-iot-sdk from [azure-iot-sdk-sys](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/azure-iot-sdk-sys.git).

A reference implementaion showing how this framework might be used can be found [here](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iot-client-template-rs).

The rustdoc documentation of the SDK can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?/doc/azure_iot_sdk/index.html).
